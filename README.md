# Train Track

Train track is project for detecting and predicting the schedule of passing trains. It uses a webcam for visual input to detect the train's presence and direction. An undetermined algorithm will take the empirical observations and provide arrival predictions for future trains. Plugins, such as a slack bot and email alerts, could be added later.
